Overview
---
Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree Project #2 implementation and submission.

The program in this project submission implements Traffic Sign Recognition, using deep neural network and convolutional neural network model techniques.

The model is trained and validated for classifying traffic sign images using the provided German Traffic Sign Dataset.

The model is also verified against an independent set of images of German traffic signs that I found on the Internet.

To meet specifications, the project submission includes the following three main files  (among other included support files): 
* The Ipython Notebook with the program code
* The code exported as an HTML file
* A writeup report in pdf file format

Please refer to the submitted writeup report file (which can also be found in the GitHub development repository for this project: https://github.com/blunderbuss9/CarND-TSC-StewartTeaze), for a detailed description of the code used in each step of the program, as well as links to other supporting documents and external references.  Images are also included in the writeup to demonstrate how the code works with examples.  

The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report
